## 🧠 AI Integration (Hugging Face)

* Using hosted models like:

  * `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad` for Q\&A extraction
  * `facebook/bart-large-cnn` for summarization
* API: [https://huggingface.co/inference-api](https://huggingface.co/inference-api)
* **Why Hugging Face?**

  * Hosted models = zero local compute needed
  * Free tier supports ~~30–50 inference calls per day (~~\$0.10 cap)

### Example API Call:

```js
const response = await fetch(
  "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer <YOUR_HF_TOKEN>",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      inputs: {
        question: "What is the purpose of NeuroCards?",
        context: "NeuroCards is a web app that turns your notes into flashcards...",
      },
    }),
  }
);
const result = await response.json();
```

SOLUTION:







NeuroCards - Activate Your Memory Muscle

NeuroCards is an MERN+AI based app which can help to create flashcards from text,video and photos using AI APIs Hugging Face API , helping learners learn faster,  along with AI powered quizzes. The proposed web app ‘NeuroCards’ will be user friendly, scalable and customisable, making it a good Digital Experience Platform (DXP).





1. Background & Problem Statement
Learners accumulate vast amounts of materials—PDFs, lecture slides, notes, and videos—but rarely convert them into active‑recall tools such as flashcards due to the manual effort involved. Passive review of content leads to lower retention and engagement. Existing solutions often require extensive manual input or paid AI services, placing them out of reach for many students and self‑learners, especially those on tight budgets or limited hardware resources.



2. Proposed Solution
NeuroCards addresses these challenges by automating the entire flashcard creation pipeline through a simple, user‑friendly web interface and a hosted inference API:
Material Ingestion


Users upload PDFs, images, text files, or video links.


Text is extracted using open‑source parsers (e.g., pdf-parse) and OCR libraries (e.g., Tesseract.js) for images; speech‑to‑text for videos via open‑source models like Vosk.


AI‑Powered Q&A Generation


Each document chunk (≈300 tokens) is sent to the Hugging Face Inference API (free tier) running a distilled QA model (distilbert‑base‑cased‑distilled‑squad).


The API returns the top answers and confidence scores, which we format into question–answer pairs.


This offloads heavy compute from the user’s machine completely—ideal even light machines with low RAM storage or CPU speeds.


Flashcard Management & Quiz Mode


Generated cards are stored per user in MongoDB Atlas (free tier).


Users can review, edit, and tag cards via an intuitive React/Next.js interface.


A spaced‑repetition quiz scheduler presents cards based on past performance, reinforcing long‑term retention.


Analytics & Dashboard


A dashboard displays progress charts (cards created, correct responses, upcoming reviews) and lets learners track their improvement over time.

Hugging Face API Integration
API Token: Create a read‑only token from Hugging Face and set HF_API_TOKEN in environment variables.


Adapter Module: A Node.js function wraps fetch() calls to https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad.


Chunking & Caching: Documents are split into overlapping 300‑token segments. Each segment’s Q&A is cached in MongoDB to avoid repeated API charges.

6. Potential Impact & Scalability
Accessibility: Completely free and open‑source—anyone with a browser can use it.


Hardware‑Independent: Hosted API eliminates local compute constraints, making it ideal for low‑end devices.


Educational Reach: Bridges content consumption to active learning, improving retention across disciplines.


DXP‑Ready: Modular design allows future integration of gamification, social learning, or LTI connectors for LMS platforms.


Cost‑Effective Scaling:


Vercel auto‑scales functions based on demand.


MongoDB Atlas free tier supports initial user base; easy to upgrade.


HF API costs are capped by free‑tier quotas, and caching minimizes requests.


7. Alignment with current need of learners
Problem Relevance & Feasibility: Addresses a clear learning‑retention gap with proven active‑recall techniques.


Clarity & Innovation: Fully automated pipeline, API‑first AI inference suited to low‑resource hardware.


Full‑Stack SaaS Suitability: Uses modern serverless and API‑driven architecture, CI/CD, and free‑tier services for rapid, zero‑cost/low-cost deployment.


NeuroCards delivers a robust, user‑centric Digital Experience Platform in under two weeks—transforming passive study materials into personalized, AI‑powered flashcards and quizzes.
